# Maximum_Flow

Introduction
It is JAVAFx application which aids in creating graphs and finds maximum flow of them. Everything is visualized from the original graph creation, showing the max flow graph, augmented paths, and residual graphs. Ford Fulkerson Edmond Karp Algorithm is used to find the maximum flow.

Steps
1. Create graph either using auto generation or manually.
2. Edit the graph whenever you want
3. Click Maximum Flow to find the maximum flow
3. Clik residual graph or augmented paths to find them

Everything is visualized using JGraphX on top of JGraphT.
